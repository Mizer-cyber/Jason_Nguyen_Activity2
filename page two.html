<h1>Hobbies.</h1>

<p>I happen to have a few hobbies I like to do. Though one is within the realm of IT.</p>
<p>That hobby in IT happens to be PC Building.</p>
<p>I am into building a pc and my current rig is the result of that hobby.</p>
<p>I'm also into video games.</p>
<p>Though I prefer horror and rpg games.</p>
<p>The last hobby I am interested in is video creation.</p>
<p>This one is more for skill building. So I tend to do this for resume filler.</p>
<p>That's the hobbies I'm into at the moment.</p>
